# VBA-Marketing-Analytics-Chart/Presentation-Automation
This tool leverages an Excel workbook to automatically build unique workbooks and presentations for distribution to the general marketing team. It was built as a way to dramatically cut down on the time and effort required to produce system-wide quarterly reports. Additionaly, the workbook and code serve as a warehouse for ad hoc analysis so that we can quickly implement it into reports and are not replicating old analysis.
The primary requirement was that all subsequent additions to the reporting could be made without any interaction with VBA. As such, additions are made based on Excel input, a medium far more familiar to the marketing team.
